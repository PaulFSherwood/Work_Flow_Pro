# Work_Flow_Pro
Work order tracking applications in PyQt5/6

This project will allow users to add, alter, and remove inventory, add, alter, and remove work orders, and maintain repair times and cost per part repaired.  View and maintain management overview dashboard.
Currently, we operate out of an Excel sheet that has been damaged multiple times while adding maintenance and manager notes.  Currently, inventory is impossible to create, and management cannot monitor repairs and costs to the company.
