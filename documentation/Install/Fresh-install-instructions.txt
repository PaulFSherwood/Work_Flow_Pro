Install MySQL WorkBench
From https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ 
download mysql-workbench-community_8.0.34-1ubuntu22.04_amd64.deb
or a version that suites your OS.
Open command prompt in that folder and run install command
>sudo dpkg -i  mysql-workbench-community_8.0.34-1ubuntu22.04_amd64.deb
You should have no errors, if you do you may have to run

If no fire wall exists open MySQL WorkBench and try to connect to your server
